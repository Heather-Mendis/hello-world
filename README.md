# hello-world
First repository

My name is Heather Mendis and this is one of the first couses i started!
I love sunflowers and YA literature and...well I'm not too bad at playing the guitar :)
Afterall, what better way to avoid passing out from boredom during the lockdown than actually doing something fun and productive?!

I'm really looking forward to learning about this course and hope you guys are too!
All the best guys, and stay safe!
:D
